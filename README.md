# Lattice-Boltzmann-weights
Python script to calculate the weights of the (user-supplied) shells of a Lattice Boltzmann model on a simple cubic lattice, based upon numerically solving the Maxwell-Boltzmann constraint equations. The script supports arbitrary spacial dimensions and arbitrary tensor ranks up to which the Maxwell-Boltzmann constraints must hold. Only unique solutions are admitted.
